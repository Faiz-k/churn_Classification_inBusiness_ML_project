Title: Customer Churn Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier



Overview:
Welcome to the "Customer Churn Classification" project repository! This machine learning project utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (exit) based on various customer parameters. The output of this project is a binary classification: 1 indicates that the customer is expected to exit, while 0 indicates that they are likely to stay.

Dataset:
This project makes use of a comprehensive dataset containing a range of customer attributes, including:
1. Row Number
2. Customer ID
3. Surname
4. Credit Score
5. Geography
6. Gender
7. Age
8. Tenure
9. Balance
10. Number of Products
11. Has Credit Card
12. IsActiveMember
13. Estimated Salary

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can classify customers into two categories: those likely to churn and those likely to remain with the business. Identifying potential churners early allows businesses to take proactive steps to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

Methodology:
Within this repository, you will find the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. KNN is particularly suitable for this project because it makes predictions based on the similarity between a customer's attributes and those of its nearest neighbors.

Key Features:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes data preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset for model training.
2. **KNN Classifier**: The core of the project is the KNN classifier. The classifier is trained on the customer dataset to predict churn probability.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are employed to assess the KNN classifier's performance in predicting customer churn.
4. **Visualization**: Visualizations, such as confusion matrices and ROC curves, are provided to aid in understanding the model's performance.
5. **Model Deployment (Optional)**: If applicable, the repository may include code and instructions for deploying the trained KNN model for real-time customer churn prediction.

Getting Started:
To explore this project further or use the KNN classifier for your customer churn prediction tasks, you can clone this repository and follow the provided documentation. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed to run the code successfully.
